<h1>What is Core RBAC?</h1>
<p>
Core RBAC includes sets of five basic data elements called users (USERS),
roles (ROLES), objects (OBS), operations (OPS), and permissions (PRMS). 
</p>
<h2>RBAC model</h2>
<p>
The RBAC model as a whole is fundamentally defined in terms of individual
users being assigned to roles and permissions being assigned to roles. A
role is a means for naming many-to-many relationships  among individual
users and permissions. In addition, the core RBAC model includes a set of
sessions (SESSIONS) where each session is  a mapping between a user and an
activated subset of roles that are assigned to the user.
</p>
<h2>Users</h2>
<p>
A user is defined as a human being. Although the concept of a user  can be
extended to include machines, networks, or intelligent autonomous agents,
the definition is limited to a person in this document for simplicity
reasons. 
</p>
<h2>Roles</h2>
<p>
A role is a job function within the context of an organization  with some
associated semantics regarding the authority and  responsibility conferred
on the user assigned to the role.
</p>
<h2>Permissions</h2>
<p>
Permission is an approval to perform an operation on one or more RBAC
protected objects.
</p>
<h2>Operations</h2>
<p>
An operation is an executable image of a program, which upon invocation
executes some function for the user. The types of operations and objects
that RBAC controls are dependent on the type of system in which it will be
implemented. For example, within a file system, operations might  include
read, write, and execute; within a database management system,  operations
might include insert, delete, append and update.
</p>
<h1>Details</h1>
<p>
The purpose of any access control mechanism is to protect system resources
(i.e., protected objects). Consistent with earlier models of access control
an object is an entity that contains or receives information. 
</p>
<h2>System Implementations</h2>
<p>
For a system that implements RBAC, the objects can represent information
containers (e.g., files, directories, in an operating system, and/or
columns, rows, tables, and views within a database management system) or
objects can represent exhaustible system resources, such as printers, disk
space, and CPU cycles. 
</p>
<p>
The set of objects covered by RBAC includes all of the objects listed in
the permissions that are assigned to roles.
</p>
